TikTok users have the ability to submit reports that identify videos and comments that contain user claims. 
These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. The process generates a large number of user reports that are challenging to consider in a timely manner. 

TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. 
With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.

Project background
TikTok’s data team is in the earliest stages of the claims classification project. 
The following tasks are needed before the team can begin the data analysis process:

  - Build a dataframe for the TikTok dataset
  - Examine data type of each column
  - Gather descriptive statistics

Your assignment
You will build a dataframe for the claims classification data. 
After the dataframe is complete, you will organize the claims data for the process of exploratory data analysis, and update the team on your progress and insights.
