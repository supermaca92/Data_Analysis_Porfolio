Automatidata works with its clients to transform unused and stored data into useful solutions, such as performance dashboards, customer-facing tools, strategic business insights, and more.
They specialize in identifying a client's business needs and utilizing their data to meet them. 

Automatidata is consulting for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). 
New York City TLC is an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles. 
The agency has partnered with Automatidata to develop a regression model that helps estimate taxi fares before the ride based on data that TLC has gathered.

The TLC data comes from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, making approximately one million combined daily trips.

Note: This project's dataset was created for pedagogical purposes and may not indicate New York City taxi cab riders' behaviour.
