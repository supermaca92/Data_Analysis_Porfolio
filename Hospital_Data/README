# HOSPITAL DATA PROJECT

## Objective

Patient data can provide an insight into how well a hospital is run. This data can be then used to track hospital performance and levels of care, providing insight into areas of improvement.

## About the dataset

The datasets for this project were obtained from the Hospital Compare web site (http://hospitalcompare.hhs.gov) run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 

The purpose of the web site is to provide data and information about the quality of care at over 4,000 Medicare-certified hospitals in the U.S. This dataset essentially covers all major U.S. hospitals. This dataset is used for a variety of purposes, including determining whether hospitals should be fined for not providing high quality care to patients (see http://goo.gl/jAXFX for some background on this particular topic).
The hospitals Compare website contains a lot of data and we will only look at a small subset for this project. The files used for this project are:
- outcomes-of-care-measures.csv --> contains information about 30-days mortality and readmissions rates for heart attack, heart failure and pneumonia for over 4,000 hospitals
- hospitals-data.csv --> contains information about each hospital 
- hospital_revised_flatfiles.pdf --> descriptions of variables in each file (i.e. the code book)

## Tasks

The following tasks were performed:

1. Plot the 30-day mortality rates for Heart Attack
2. Finding the best Hospital in a state
3. Ranking the hospitals by outcome in a state
4. Ranking hospitals in all states
## Guidelines to use the script:
